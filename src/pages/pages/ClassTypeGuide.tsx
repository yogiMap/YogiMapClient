            <p>
              Acro-yoga is a physical practice which blends elements of yoga, acrobatics, and healing arts to form a
              practice that cultivates trust, connection and playfulness between partners. This type of yoga is
              interactive and fun. Classes typically include partner-assisted postures, some massage and simple
              acrobatics techniques accessible to all levels of practitioners. There are 7 main elements that make up
              the practice: circle ceremony, postures, massage, partner flow, therapeutic flying, inversions and
              spotting, and partner acrobatics.{' '}

            </h3>
            <p>
              Aerial Yoga is a relatively new way to practice yoga. In an Aerial Yoga class students practice the
              various postures and movements while suspended a few inches off the ground (over soft mats) by a
              hammock-like long piece of cloth, holding them by the waist. Aerial Yoga is designed to counteract gravity
              and increase flexibility by relieving compression, which releases tension, straightens the shoulders, and
              elongates the spine. This type of yoga is a fun practice for beginners and more advanced yogis. Beginner
              classes typically start on the floor and gradually move on to using the trapeze.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Alignment is a general term used in yoga to refer to the precise way in which the body should be
              positioned in each posture to avoid injury and obtain the maximum benefits. Some classes offer a specific
              focus on alignment. These classes generally provide individualized adjustment in the different poses so
              that students learn how to change or correct their own posture. Alignment-focused classes develop the
              strength, flexibility, and balance, and usually are very beneficial to beginners.

              This is low-impact yoga in a pool, where the warmth of the water encourages joints to open and muscles to
              relax. It's an excellent therapeutic modality for people who are challenged by practicing on a mat, as the
              weightlessness in the water takes the stress out of challenged joints. But, Aqua Yoga isn't just for those
              with dry-land limitations: an experienced practitioner can try new or challenging poses, and also get
              deeper into familiar poses in a relaxing environment.

              Broga is a yoga class for men (where "it’s okay if you can’t touch your toes"). Created by Robert Sidoti,
              it can be described as strong, energetic,and challenging, combining core-strengthening, muscle-toning,
              cardio-working, stress-reducing, clarity-enhancing yoga postures with functional fitness exercises. While

            <p>
              Chair Yoga is one of the most gentle forms of yoga. It is practiced sitting on a chair, or standing and
              using a chair for support. The poses taught in a Chair Yoga class are often adaptions of Hatha Yoga poses.
              Chair Yoga classes are often taught in senior centers, and physical rehabilitation centers. Students learn
              many kinds of yoga postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and ways of relaxation, with the aid of a
              chair. This type of yoga is great for people with physical restrictions who are unable to participate in a
              'traditional' yoga class, and it is a great way to increase flexibility, strength and balance.

              movement to breath. They may also include work on the idea of core not only as a precise physical area,

              Laughter yoga (Hasyayoga) is a practice involving prolonged voluntary laughter. It's based on the belief
              that this provides the same physiological and psychological benefits as spontaneous laughter. Done in
              groups, laughter is initially simulated as a physical exercise while maintaining eye contact with others
              in the group and promoting childlike playfulness. In most cases this soon leads to real and contagious

              Mom and Baby yoga classes generally accommodate babies aged six weeks to crawling. In most classes, moms
              will place a yoga blanket (that can be covered with a blanket from home) at the top of their yoga mat. The
              baby will lie on the blanket for the duration of the class, and moms are entirely free to pick up, hold,
              feed, or change their baby during the class. It is never a problem if the baby cries. Some classes are
              very gentle and may focus on playing with the babies (moms can also bring a few small toys), while others
              offer more exercise and less playtime. Mom and Baby classes can also provide a quiet place to meet other
              new mothers.

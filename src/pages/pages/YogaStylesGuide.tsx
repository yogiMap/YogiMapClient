            </h3>
            <p>
              Agama is a Tantric Yoga school dedicated to traditional Hindu and Bhuddist methods of teaching
              spirituality. It offers a synthesis between the rational thinking of the West and the mystical traditions
              of the East. Asanas (poses) are held for longer periods than in most other styles, with a focus on energy
              centres (chakras). Classes are both dynamic and meditative, and are suitable for beginners and
              intermediate practitioners alike.{' '}

            <p>
              Created by Yogrishi Vishvketu, Akhanda Yoga classes balance all of the directional movements of the spine
              (flexion, extension, lateral flexion, rotation, and grounding), in all of the stations (standing,
              crouching, sitting, laying on the belly, laying on the back, arm balances and inversions). This style
              offers a balance between yang and yin - effort and allowing, in postures, meditation, and life. This style
              offers studies in asana, pranayama, mantra, visualization, relaxation and meditation.

            <p>
              Ananda is a classical style of yoga that combines postures and breath with the goal of harmonizing the
              body, mind, and spirit. Ananda Yoga enables the exploration of the inner dimensions of yoga and
              self-awareness, and it is designed to prepare the mind and the body for deep meditation. The use of
              affirmations while in the postures is a distinct feature of Ananda Yoga. A typical class includes
              postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and teachings on yoga philosophy. Classes also focus on proper
              alignment and posture transitions. Ananda is a relatively gentle experience, and is suitable for all ages,
              body types and physical conditions. It is based on the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda (author of the
              spiritual classic, Autobiography of a Yogi). It was developed by Swami Kriyananda (Donald J. Walters), a
              direct disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda.{' '}

            <p>
              Antastha Yoga is a practice of self- study, and withdrawal of sense achieved by using a blindfold. Being
              blindfolded enhances the practice of the asana and supports practitioners to reach a meditational state.
              Without a point of visual reference, the mind sharpens and increases the understanding and grasp of
              multidimensionality, in its purest form. The practice includes self-massage and hands-on adjustments, all
              combined to attune to the being while cutting off from physical and emotional blocks.

            <p>
              Founded in 1997 by John Friend, Anusara is a modern school of yoga that integrates a strong emphasis on
              physical alignment with a positive, heart-oriented, and spiritually inspiring philosophy, whose premise is
              the belief in intrinsic goodness. Anusara classes focus on attitude, alignment, and action, and are
              accessible to students of different ages and abilities. Props (such as straps, block and pillows) are
              often used, and students are taught to open their heart, both physically and spiritually.{' '}

            <p>
              In Ashtanga Yoga students perform a set series of postures, always in the same order, beginning with a
              sequence know as Sun Salutations, and move from one pose to the next in a continual flow that links
              movement to breath. This vigorous practice produces intense internal heat that creates a strong body and a
              calm mind. Ashtanga Yoga builds strength, flexibility, and stamina, and is often considered to be more
              physically demanding than other types of yoga. Developed by K. Pattabhi Jois, this style of yoga uses a
              system based on six series of increasing difficulty. Ashtanga is the inspiration for the majority of
              vinyasa style yoga classes and for Power Yoga.{' '}

              Developed by long-time practitioner Baron Baptiste, Baptiste Yoga combines elements of classical yoga
              (Ashtanga, Iyengar and Bikram) to build a practice that combines physical fitness with intuitive spiritual
              self-discovery. Baptiste Yoga classes offer a vigorous and challenging 90-minute flowing sequence in a
              heated room. While generally geared towards more athletic practitioners, everyone is welcome. Baptiste
              Yoga encourages students to work according to their own fitness level in order to bring personal

            <p>
              Created by Bikram Choudhury, Bikram Yoga consists of a series of yoga poses performed in a heated room
              (usually 105¼ F/ 40¼ C). Bikram classes offer a vigorous and physically demanding practice that will get
              the heart rate up. Each class features a vigorous 90-minute sequence of 26 postures and two breathing
              exercises always performed in the same order. Yoga at this temperature promotes profuse sweating and
              increases flexibility. Bikram Yoga is designed to help rid the body of toxins while systematically working
              every part of the body to give it everything it needs to maintain optimum health.

              Dru yoga is a style of yoga that works with postures, breath work, relaxation and meditation. Its series
              or sequences are called 'Energy Block Release' and include flowing movements, directed breathing and

              Flow is a general term that can be applied to many different styles of yoga and it refers to a sequence of
              postures that includes fluid movements and transitions. It can also refer to linking movement to breath
              while performing (and transitioning between) postures. Flow classes can range from gentle to athlethic,
              with other specific elements of focus determined by the style of yoga practiced in the class.

              Hatha is a general term that encompasses many physical styles of yoga. Hatha classes are generally gentle
              and slow-paced, and provide a good introduction to the basic postures and principles of yoga.

            <p>
              Hot Yoga is typically performed in a room heated to around 100° F/ 37° C. The heat promotes a deeper
              flexibility in each pose, and sweat helps the body release toxins. Hot Yoga classes generally offer a
              fluid practice but they may vary depending on the teaching style. Hot Yoga tends to be strenuous with the
              heat adding to the difficulty of the class.

              Integral Yoga is a gentle practice that promotes the return to a sense of strength, health, calm and clear
              mind, love, and joy. Integral Yoga is accessible to all students. It uses classical yoga postures
              performed as a meditation, balancing physical effort and relaxation. A typical class will include
              postures, breathing techniques, chanting, guided relaxation, and meditation. Swami Satchidananda founded
              Integral Yoga after studying intensively with Swami Sivananda. His goal was to help people integrate the

              system that is designed to help students of all ages achieve balance and create a foundation for spiritual
              growth by expanding their awareness to the universal state of bliss. ISHTA Yoga caters to individual
              students' needs and encourages every type of student to find contentment and calm. Typical ISHTA classes
              are built around a theme, and consist of a flowing sequence of postures with a focus on alignment. They
              generally also include breathing exercises, meditation and cleansing techniques.{' '}

              Developed by B.K.S Iyengar, this style of yoga is known for great attention to detail and focus on
              alignment, the precise way in which the body should be positioned to obtain the maximum benefits in each
              pose and avoid injury. A typical Iyengar class moves at a gentle pace and encourages students to penetrate
              deeper into each pose with adjustments given by the teacher. Poses (especially standing postures) are held
              for a longer amount of time than in other yoga styles and students are shown how to use props (such as
              straps, blankets, and blocks) to bring the body into alignment and to help accommodate special needs such
              as injuries or structural imbalances. This style of yoga is great for beginners, and it emphasizes the
              development of strength, flexibility, and balance. Iyengar Yoga aims to unite the body, mind, and spirit
              to promote well-being. Iyengar teachers complete an intense and rigorous 2-5 year training program for
              certification.

              It emphasizes chanting, meditation, spiritual teachings, and how to apply yogic philosophy to daily life.
              Jivamukti classes offer a vigorous flowing physical practice, and foster intellectual stimulation to lead
              to spiritual awareness. Classes often focus on a theme, and include breathing techniques, chanting,
              readings, and eclectic music. One of the core principles of Jivamukti Yoga is non-harming (Ahimsa) and
              classes often promote environmentalism, animal rights, and veganism.

              A Kirtan performance includes an accompaniment of musical instruments, such as the harmonium, the tabla,
              flute, and cymbals. It is sometimes accompanied by story-telling and acting. Texts typically cover

              with an emphasis on meditation, physical healing and spiritual transformation that will enable students to
              thrive in all aspects of life. Kripalu Yoga focuses on looking inward and moving at one's own pace while
              coordinating breath and movement to honor the wisdom of the body. Classes can vary from gentle to
              strenuous, and teachers will always encourage students to listen their bodies and let that be the guide to
              their practice. Kripalu Yoga leads the student through three stages: Stage 1 begins with the steady
              practice of postures (with a focus on breath, alignment, and consciousness); Stage 2 involves holding the
              postures longer, and deepening inner awareness; Stage 3 takes students to a meditation in motion in which
              movement from one posture to another arises spontaneously.{' '}

              Mahavatar Babaji Nagaraj, as a synthesis of ancient teachings of the 18 Siddha tradition. It includes a
              series of techniques or 'kriyas' grouped into five phases or branches: asanas, pranayama, meditation,
              mantras and bhakti, which leads to an integrated development of human potential, physically, vitally,
              mentally, and spiritually. Paramahamsa Yogananda taught that practice of Kriya Kundalini Pranayama can
              accelerate the natural progression of Divine Consciousness in human beings. Babaji's Kriya Yoga is a path
              of self-realization in which the physical body is seen as the temple of the Divine.

              Kundalini is an ancient form of yoga that aims to develop spiritual awareness, and to release the

              the controlled release of Kundalini energy, the energy which is found at the base of the spine, with the
              purpose of freeing energy in the lower body and allowing it to move up through the body. The practice
              involves postures, with an emphasis on dynamic breathing techniques, meditation, and chanting. Kundalini
              is one of the more spiritual styles of yoga that goes beyond the physical poses. Kundalini sequences can

              Laughter yoga (Hasyayoga) is a practice involving prolonged voluntary laughter. It's based on the belief

              own portion of the Ashtanga sequence at their own pace, and the teacher assists each student with
              adjustments and instructions. In Ashtanga Yoga, postures are performed in sequential order. Each posture
              builds from the previous, and prepares for the next one. Beginning students have a shorter practice than
              more advanced ones. As their practice develops, additional postures are given to the students. The Mysore
              style teaches yoga according to each individual's ability, and accommodates all levels.

            <p>
              Power Yoga is a general term used to describe classes that are often based on the flowing and dynamic
              style of Ashtanga Yoga, but that don't necessarily follow the same set series of poses. Classes can vary
              depending on the teacher, but they generally offer a vigorous workout that develops strength and
              flexibility while keeping students moving. Power Yoga classes often target different muscle groups; they
              can be as challenging for the mind as they are for the body. Power Yoga generally appeals to people who
              enjoy exercise, and prefer a minimal amount of meditation and chanting.

              strain on the body. The final relaxation is usually held for 20 minutes to allow complete rest.

              Tantra is an inter-religious spiritual movement that arose in medieval India in the fifth century CE,
              where practitioners invoke the sacred in everything and attempt to connect to the spiritual essence of the
              universe with everyday experiences. While other spiritual traditions commonly teach that desire for
              material pleasures and spiritual aspirations are mutually exclusive, Tantra is different: it takes worldly
              desires into account. Thus, for some people, "Tantra" has become a synonym for "spiritual sex", where
              love-making is viewed as a sacred act which is capable of elevating its participants to a more sublime
              spiritual plane.

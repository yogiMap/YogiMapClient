              Acro-yoga is a physical practice which blends elements of yoga, acrobatics, and healing arts to form a
              practice that cultivates trust, connection and playfulness between partners. This type of yoga is
              interactive and fun. Classes typically include partner-assisted postures, some massage and simple
              acrobatics techniques accessible to all levels of practitioners. There are 7 main elements that make up
              the practice: circle ceremony, postures, massage, partner flow, therapeutic flying, inversions and
              spotting, and partner acrobatics.{' '}

            </h3>
            <p>
              Aerial Yoga is a relatively new way to practice yoga. In an Aerial Yoga class students practice the
              various postures and movements while suspended a few inches off the ground (over soft mats) by a
              hammock-like long piece of cloth, holding them by the waist. Aerial Yoga is designed to counteract gravity
              and increase flexibility by relieving compression, which releases tension, straightens the shoulders, and
              elongates the spine. This type of yoga is a fun practice for beginners and more advanced yogis. Beginner
              classes typically start on the floor and gradually move on to using the trapeze.

            <p>
              Agama is a Tantric Yoga school dedicated to traditional Hindu and Bhuddist methods of teaching
              spirituality. It offers a synthesis between the rational thinking of the West and the mystical traditions
              of the East. Asanas (poses) are held for longer periods than in most other styles, with a focus on energy
              centres (chakras). Classes are both dynamic and meditative, and are suitable for beginners and
              intermediate practitioners alike.{' '}

            <p>
              Created by Yogrishi Vishvketu, Akhanda Yoga classes balance all of the directional movements of the spine
              (flexion, extension, lateral flexion, rotation, and grounding), in all of the stations (standing,
              crouching, sitting, laying on the belly, laying on the back, arm balances and inversions). This style
              offers a balance between yang and yin - effort and allowing, in postures, meditation, and life. This style
              offers studies in asana, pranayama, mantra, visualization, relaxation and meditation.

            <p>
              Alignment is a general term used in yoga to refer to the precise way in which the body should be
              positioned in each posture to avoid injury and obtain the maximum benefits. Some classes offer a specific
              focus on alignment. These classes generally provide individualized adjustment in the different poses so
              that students learn how to change or correct their own posture. Alignment-focused classes develop the
              strength, flexibility, and balance, and usually are very beneficial to beginners.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Ananda is a classical style of yoga that combines postures and breath with the goal of harmonizing the
              body, mind, and spirit. Ananda Yoga enables the exploration of the inner dimensions of yoga and
              self-awareness, and it is designed to prepare the mind and the body for deep meditation. The use of
              affirmations while in the postures is a distinct feature of Ananda Yoga. A typical class includes
              postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and teachings on yoga philosophy. Classes also focus on proper
              alignment and posture transitions. Ananda is a relatively gentle experience, and is suitable for all ages,
              body types and physical conditions. It is based on the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda (author of the
              spiritual classic, Autobiography of a Yogi). It was developed by Swami Kriyananda (Donald J. Walters), a
              direct disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda.{' '}

            </h3>
            <p>
              Antastha Yoga is a practice of self- study, and withdrawal of sense achieved by using a blindfold. Being
              blindfolded enhances the practice of the asana and supports practitioners to reach a meditational state.
              Without a point of visual reference, the mind sharpens and increases the understanding and grasp of
              multidimensionality, in its purest form. The practice includes self-massage and hands-on adjustments, all
              combined to attune to the being while cutting off from physical and emotional blocks.

              Founded in 1997 by John Friend, Anusara is a modern school of yoga that integrates a strong emphasis on
              physical alignment with a positive, heart-oriented, and spiritually inspiring philosophy, whose premise is
              the belief in intrinsic goodness. Anusara classes focus on attitude, alignment, and action, and are
              accessible to students of different ages and abilities. Props (such as straps, block and pillows) are
              often used, and students are taught to open their heart, both physically and spiritually.{' '}

            <p>
              This is low-impact yoga in a pool, where the warmth of the water encourages joints to open and muscles to
              relax. It's an excellent therapeutic modality for people who are challenged by practicing on a mat, as the
              weightlessness in the water takes the stress out of challenged joints. But, Aqua Yoga isn't just for those
              with dry-land limitations: an experienced practitioner can try new or challenging poses, and also get
              deeper into familiar poses in a relaxing environment.

              In Ashtanga Yoga students perform a set series of postures, always in the same order, beginning with a
              sequence know as Sun Salutations, and move from one pose to the next in a continual flow that links
              movement to breath. This vigorous practice produces intense internal heat that creates a strong body and a
              calm mind. Ashtanga Yoga builds strength, flexibility, and stamina, and is often considered to be more
              physically demanding than other types of yoga. Developed by K. Pattabhi Jois, this style of yoga uses a
              system based on six series of increasing difficulty. Ashtanga is the inspiration for the majority of
              vinyasa style yoga classes and for Power Yoga.{' '}

              (Ashtanga, Iyengar and Bikram) to build a practice that combines physical fitness with intuitive spiritual
              self-discovery. Baptiste Yoga classes offer a vigorous and challenging 90-minute flowing sequence in a
              heated room. While generally geared towards more athletic practitioners, everyone is welcome. Baptiste
              Yoga encourages students to work according to their own fitness level in order to bring personal

              Created by Bikram Choudhury, Bikram Yoga consists of a series of yoga poses performed in a heated room
              (usually 105¼ F/ 40¼ C). Bikram classes offer a vigorous and physically demanding practice that will get
              the heart rate up. Each class features a vigorous 90-minute sequence of 26 postures and two breathing
              exercises always performed in the same order. Yoga at this temperature promotes profuse sweating and
              increases flexibility. Bikram Yoga is designed to help rid the body of toxins while systematically working
              every part of the body to give it everything it needs to maintain optimum health.

            <p>
              Chair Yoga is one of the most gentle forms of yoga. It is practiced sitting on a chair, or standing and
              using a chair for support. The poses taught in a Chair Yoga class are often adaptions of Hatha Yoga poses.
              Chair Yoga classes are often taught in senior centers, and physical rehabilitation centers. Students learn
              many kinds of yoga postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and ways of relaxation, with the aid of a
              chair. This type of yoga is great for people with physical restrictions who are unable to participate in a
              'traditional' yoga class, and it is a great way to increase flexibility, strength and balance.

              readings, and eclectic music. One of the core principles of Jivamukti Yoga is non-harming (Ahimsa) and
              classes often promote environmentalism, animal rights, and veganism.

              structured to engage the audience where they either repeat the chant, or reply to the call of the singer.
              A Kirtan performance includes an accompaniment of musical instruments, such as the harmonium, the tabla,
              flute, and cymbals. It is sometimes accompanied by story-telling and acting. Texts typically cover
              religious, mythological or social subjects.

            <p>
              Developed by Amrit Desai, Kripalu Yoga, sometimes described as the yoga of consciousness, is a practice
              with an emphasis on meditation, physical healing and spiritual transformation that will enable students to
              thrive in all aspects of life. Kripalu Yoga focuses on looking inward and moving at one's own pace while
              coordinating breath and movement to honor the wisdom of the body. Classes can vary from gentle to
              strenuous, and teachers will always encourage students to listen their bodies and let that be the guide to
              their practice. Kripalu Yoga leads the student through three stages: Stage 1 begins with the steady
              practice of postures (with a focus on breath, alignment, and consciousness); Stage 2 involves holding the
              postures longer, and deepening inner awareness; Stage 3 takes students to a meditation in motion in which
              movement from one posture to another arises spontaneously.{' '}

              Kriya Yoga is described by its practitioners as the ancient Yoga system revived in modern times by
              Mahavatar Babaji Nagaraj, as a synthesis of ancient teachings of the 18 Siddha tradition. It includes a
              series of techniques or 'kriyas' grouped into five phases or branches: asanas, pranayama, meditation,
              mantras and bhakti, which leads to an integrated development of human potential, physically, vitally,
              mentally, and spiritually. Paramahamsa Yogananda taught that practice of Kriya Kundalini Pranayama can
              accelerate the natural progression of Divine Consciousness in human beings. Babaji's Kriya Yoga is a path
              of self-realization in which the physical body is seen as the temple of the Divine.

              Kundalini is an ancient form of yoga that aims to develop spiritual awareness, and to release the
              practitioner's full potential by building physical vitality and increasing consciousness. It focuses on
              the controlled release of Kundalini energy, the energy which is found at the base of the spine, with the
              purpose of freeing energy in the lower body and allowing it to move up through the body. The practice
              involves postures, with an emphasis on dynamic breathing techniques, meditation, and chanting. Kundalini
              is one of the more spiritual styles of yoga that goes beyond the physical poses. Kundalini sequences can
              be physically demanding, and are great for those looking to challenge themselves both physically and
              mentally.

              Laughter yoga (Hasyayoga) is a practice involving prolonged voluntary laughter. It's based on the belief

              groups, laughter is initially simulated as a physical exercise while maintaining eye contact with others
              in the group and promoting childlike playfulness. In most cases this soon leads to real and contagious

              own portion of the Ashtanga sequence at their own pace, and the teacher assists each student with
              adjustments and instructions. In Ashtanga Yoga, postures are performed in sequential order. Each posture
              builds from the previous, and prepares for the next one. Beginning students have a shorter practice than
              more advanced ones. As their practice develops, additional postures are given to the students. The Mysore
              style teaches yoga according to each individual's ability, and accommodates all levels.

            <p>
              Codified by Master DeRose in Brazil, SwáSthya Yôga is the most popular yoga style in Brazil and Argentina.
              It strictly follows an ancient yoga tradition with roots in Tantra and Samkhya yoga. Although it's highly
              acrobatic and explores the limits of strength, balance and flexibility, it's more than just a workout:
              meditation and breath control are central components of the practice. It also fully covers the philosophy
              of yoga, but without mystical or spiritual connotation. FYI: to become an instructor of this style takes
              12 years!{' '}

            </h3>
            <p>
              Tantra is an inter-religious spiritual movement that arose in medieval India in the fifth century CE,
              where practitioners invoke the sacred in everything and attempt to connect to the spiritual essence of the
              universe with everyday experiences. While other spiritual traditions commonly teach that desire for
              material pleasures and spiritual aspirations are mutually exclusive, Tantra is different: it takes worldly
              desires into account. Thus, for some people, "Tantra" has become a synonym for "spiritual sex", where
              love-making is viewed as a sacred act which is capable of elevating its participants to a more sublime
              spiritual plane.

              A system of massage and manipulation developed in Thailand, and influenced by the traditional medicine
              systems of India, China, and Southeast Asia, as well as by yoga. Developed more than 2,500 years ago in
              India, it's related to yoga because the therapist uses his or her hands, knees, legs, and feet to move you
              into a series of yoga-like stretches. Many people say Thai yoga massage is like doing yoga without any
              work.

              Vijñāna Yoga was founded in 2003 by Orit Sen-Gupta. This type of yoga stems from the yogic tradition of
              northern India, as taught by Sri Krishnamacharya. The four main practices of Vijñāna Yoga are finding true
              alignment in asana practice, extensive practice of pranayama, the practice of meditation, and the study of
              yogic texts. The term vijñāna means "understanding from inside".

            <p>
              Viniyoga is a gentle and fluid form of yoga that emphasizes the coordination of breath and movement. The
              flowing Viniyoga sequence is similar to the series practiced in Ashtanga Yoga, but it is performed at a
              much slower pace. Classes can vary in length and content, and sequences are tailored to students' needs
              and physical condition. Viniyoga enables students to begin the process of self-discovery and individual
              transformation. Students are taught how to use postures, breathing techniques, chanting, and meditation in
              an individual practice. Viniyoga places less stress on the joints, and is very accesible to beginners.

              Vinyasa is a general term that means 'to move with the breath', and it is used to describe different types
              of classes. Some of the most popular styles of yoga, such as Ashtanga and Power Yoga, are taught in
              vinyasa style Ð meaning the series of postures flows with the breath. Vinyasa Flow classes generally offer
              a more varied sequence than Ashtanga classes. They tend to be vigorous classes and generally start with a
              series of poses called Sun Salutations to warm up the body. Vinyasa Flow classes are mostly slower-paced
              than Power Yoga classes, and more vigorous than Iyengar classes. Vinyasa Flow Yoga builds strength,
              flexibility, concentration and balance.

              stages of their development. These classes show how a balanced yoga practice can help women deal with the
              different stages of their cycle, and the symptoms associated with hormonal changes. They generally help
              women build an awareness of their body and mind, and often guide women through sequences that balance

              One of the oldest recorded systems of yoga in the world, Yantra Yoga uses a sequence that consists of
              seven phases of movement, connected with seven phases of breathing. Yantra Yoga is connected with the
              essence of the Dzogchen Teachings, although practitioners do not need to follow a particular spiritual
              path. Many positions used in Yantra Yoga are similar to those of Hatha Yoga, but the way to assume and
              apply them differs significantly. The system of Yantra Yoga contains a wide range of movements that can be
              practiced by everyone.

              Yin Yoga aims to help move the flow of energy in the body, and to maintain mobility in the deep connective
              tissue. It combines the use of passive and active postures, breathing techniques, and meditation. Classes
              typically offer a physically passive practice, and some poses can be help to up to 5 minutes. Props (such
              as blocks, straps, bolsters, and pillows) can be used to help support the practice. Many of the poses
              focus on the hips and the lower back, as these areas of the body require extra care and attention. Yin
              Yoga postures strengthen the body, enabling practitioners to sit for long periods of time during
              meditation.{' '}

              used therapeutically, yoga can affect change from within with minimal effort. The concentration that is
              required with yoga is mastered over time. The transformation that takes place through yoga therapy affects
              the body, mind, and spirit in a profound and dynamic way.

            non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service for your personal, noncommercial use only and
            as permitted by the features of the Service. YogiMap reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>YogiMap Accounts</strong>
          <p>
            Your YogiMap account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain
            from time to time and at our sole discretion. By connecting to YogiMap with a third-party service (for
            example, Facebook or Google), you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as
            permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide
            accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account,
            and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that
            use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify
            YogiMap immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. YogiMap will not be
            liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your
            “account settings” page. By providing YogiMap your email address you consent to our using the email address
            to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by
            postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of
            the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by
            clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our email messages. Opting out may prevent you from
            receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

            non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,”
            “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YogiMap
            ERP servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line
            web browser (except that YogiMap grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use
            spiders to copy materials from YogiMap for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for
            creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such
            materials); (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere
            with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers
            running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an
            unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses,
            worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally
            identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any
            commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your
            affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x)
            interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any
            technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures
            we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent
            or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content
            therein.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to
            you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily
            terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in
            our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for
            any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for your interactions with other YogiMap Users. We reserve the right, but have no
            obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. YogiMap shall have no liability for your
            interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>2. User Content</h2>
      <p>
        Some areas of the Service allow Users to post content such as profile information, comments, questions, course
        content and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes
        available on the Service “User Content”). Access to these features may be subject to age restrictions. We claim
        no ownership rights over User Content created by you. The User Content you create remains yours; however, by
        sharing User Content through the Service, you agree to allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User
        Content in accordance with your settings and this Agreement. YogiMap has the right (but not the obligation) in
        its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury,
        emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person,
        or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to
        harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details
        or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that
        we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of
        personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous,
        threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal
        (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s
        trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under
        any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you
        know is not correct and current or (ix) violates any school or other applicable policy, including those related
        to cheating or ethics. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party
        rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights
        of privacy. YogiMap reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that
        YogiMap believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions. You understand that publishing your User
        Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild
        of America, or any other rights organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights,
        mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill,
        trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence,
        and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state,
        country, territory or other jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your User Content and YogiMap’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not
            violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual
            Property Rights and privacy rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            YogiMap may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for
            payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining
            agreement or otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content you provide to us is truthful and accurate. You have
            the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content, if any, to use such
            person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and this Agreement, and each such person
            has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use. YogiMap takes no responsibility
            and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts or sends over
            the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or
            publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and
            publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is
            inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree
            that YogiMap shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>3. User Content License Grant</h2>
      <p>
        By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all
        rights necessary to grant, to YogiMap a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable,
        non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit,
        translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User
        Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any
        form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and
        YogiMap’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for promoting and
        redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any
        media channels. You also hereby grant each User of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User
        Content through the Service, and to use, display, reproduce and perform such User Content solely as permitted
        through the functionality of the Service and under this Agreement.

        limitation, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks,
        copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and User Content belonging to other Users (the “YogiMap
        Content”), and all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of YogiMap and its
        licensors (including other Users who post User Content to the Service). Except as explicitly provided herein,
        nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property Rights,
        and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display,
        publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any YogiMap Content. Use of the YogiMap
        Content for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including without
        limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Ideas”). By submitting any Idea, you agree that
        your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place YogiMap under any

      <h2>5. YogiMap Indicators</h2>
      <p>
        Certain aspects of the Service may allow you to obtain certain reputational or status indicators (for example,
        points and badges for completing courses) (“YogiMap Indicators”). You understand and agree that regardless of
        terminology used, YogiMap Indicators represent a limited license right governed solely by the terms of this
        Agreement and available for distribution at YogiMap’s sole discretion. YogiMap Indicators are not redeemable for
        any sum of money or monetary value from YogiMap at any time. You acknowledge that you do not own the account you
        use to access the Service, nor do you possess any rights of access or rights to data stored by or on behalf of
        YogiMap on YogiMap servers, including without limitation any data representing or embodying any or all of your
        YogiMap Indicators. You agree that YogiMap has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or
        eliminate YogiMap Indicators as it sees fit in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that
        YogiMap will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right. All data on YogiMap’s servers are
        subject to deletion, alteration or transfer.
      </p>

      <p>
        NOTWITHSTANDING ANY VALUE ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH DATA BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY
        DATA, ACCOUNT HISTORY AND ACCOUNT CONTENT RESIDING ON YogiMap’S SERVERS, MAY BE DELETED, ALTERED, MOVED OR

            Service, you agree to the pricing and payment terms, as we may update them from time to time. YogiMap may
            add new services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any
            time at its sole discretion. Any change to our pricing or payment terms shall become effective in the
            billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.1.2. By ordering any subscription on www.yogiMap.us you confirm that you have read and accepted our Terms
            of Service and you authorize YogiMap to automatically charge your bank card according to the billing period
            manually selected by you.
          </p>
          <p>6.1.3. The service is billed in advance on a monthly, annual, or one-time purchase basis.</p>
          <p>
            6.1.4. You may choose to set up your subscriptions as recurring, which means you will continue to get billed
            until you cancel your subscription. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your YogiMap
            subscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.1.5. If you cancel the service before the end of your current paid up period, your subscription will
            remain active until the next due date. After the due date, your subscription will be stopped.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Renewals</strong>

            Recurring YogiMap subscriptions renew automatically. If you purchase a subscription with automatic renewal,
            you acknowledge and agree that we are authorized to charge the renewal fee. Your monthly subscription will
            renew on the same day of the month, as the date you made your initial purchase. This date will be included
            on your subscription confirmation receipt that will be emailed to you at the email you provide. You may
            cancel your subscription at any time by contacting our support team via support@YogiMap ERP.us. This will

            unused time on a subscription, any license or subscription fees for any portion of the Service, any content
            or data associated with your account, or for anything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.3.2. We do not offer refunds for recurring monthly payments. If you have been billed for automatic monthly

            our support team via support@YogiMap.us in order to submit a refund request. If you don't do this, YogiMap
            ERP assumes that the service is expected, and the payment will not be refunded.

            the payment will not be refunded.

      <h2>14. Governing Law and Arbitration</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Governing Law</strong>
          <p>
            You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be
            deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over YogiMap, either specific or
            general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal
            substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties
            acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the
            preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of
            this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the
            United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree
            to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in State of California,
            Sunnyvale, for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a
            court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or
            violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or
            proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Arbitration</strong>
          <p>
            READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE
            MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM YogiMap.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the unlikely event that YogiMap has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after 60 days, we
            each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any YogiMap claims for injunctive or
            other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms of Service, or the
            breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation
            and Arbitration Services (“JAMS”) under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for
            JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in State of California, Sunnyvale, unless
            you and YogiMap agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative
            and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs
            of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any
            judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing YogiMap from seeking injunctive or other equitable
            relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of YogiMap’s proprietary interests.
            <p>
              ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
              ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE
              PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY
              NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU
              AND YogiMap ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE
              ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

          <p>
            This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with YogiMap
            in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and YogiMap concerning the
            Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
            invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement,
            which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal
            Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Waiver</strong>
          <p>
            The failure of YogiMap to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not constitute a
            waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in
            writing and signed by YogiMap.
